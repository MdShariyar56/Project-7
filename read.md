1:JSX
JSX is a syntax that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes React UI code easier to read and write.

2:State vs Props
State is internal and mutable, managed within a component. Props are read-only data passed from parent to child.

3:useState Hook
useState allows functional components to have state. It returns a state variable and a setter function to update it.

4: Share State Between Components
You can share state by lifting it to a common parent and passing it down as props along with the setter function.

5: Event Handling
React uses camelCase events like onClick. You pass a function reference to handle events.
